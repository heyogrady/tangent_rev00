# tangent_rev00
first revision of the tangent arcade game

The game idea is a simple arcade game where the player bounces around the screen while ball move from right to left. The player impacts the balls and orbits them. When the user hits a button the payer flies off tangentially. The point of the game is to stay alive as long as possible. The score is proportional to the time and the game continually speeds up.
